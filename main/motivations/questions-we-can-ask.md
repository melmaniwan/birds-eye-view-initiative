### Health, Obesity and Geographic Features

- Do (clusters of) fast food establishments as well as other geographic features strengthen models that attempt to predict obesity levels in communities?

- Are pre-existing conditions linked to obesity a good predictor for mortality due to COVID-19?

- Where are unvaccinated people clustered and are there socioeconomic and geographic commonalities of places they are located in?

### With data on Starbucks locations and other establishments associated with hipster culture and/or gentrification

- Are there a set of socioeconomic attributes across major metropolitan areas that may tell us which neighborhoods are about to undergo (or are in the process) gentrification?

- What are key socioeconomic attributes and geographic features that attract "hipsters" to a locale?

- Are certain chains or a set of establishments under the same NAICS 4 to 6 digit classification scheme popping up in an area good predictor(s) of real estate booms?

### Within College Towns using Housing, Rent and Real Estate Data

- Are there geographic features (number of public parks, museums, certain commercial hubs, small business high tech firms) and socioeconomic features (educational attainment % of individuals 25 years old and over, statistics on housing composition, median income, racial composition, etc.) that's a recurring pattern among college towns in the contiguous United States?

### Eviction Rates

- Are there cities that have above average eviction rates that are comparable in terms of socioeconomic attributes to cities with Rent Control Measures?

- What are potentially new predictors of an uptick in evictions?

### Small Businesses

- Where are small businesses being hit the hardest due to the COVID-19 Pandemic?
